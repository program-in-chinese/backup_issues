(I also use Zoom Page WE, but that seems to leave the sidebar alone.)\r\n\r\nSetting here...\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-24 um 23 41 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6339921/58358139-f2247c80-7e7d-11e9-835b-b98b565c3e30.png)\r\n\r\nto mimimum font size of 20px look like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-24 um 23 41 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6339921/58358156-05374c80-7e7e-11e9-8047-4287031d3452.png)\r\n\r\nAnd to 14px like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-24 um 23 40 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6339921/58358168-141dff00-7e7e-11e9-9cea-cd836b428680.png)\r\n\r\nSo maybe the line height does not get updated along with the font size? Still, a user customizable setting would make HiT settings independent from the overall FF settings. Some vision-impaired folks (and the tweakers, like me) would surely like that.\r\n\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe shadow is too strong, IMO, on light themes like Light (or is it Bright in English?), Chrome Grey, Solid Grey, etc.. With dark themes it looks better. As the rest of FF windows doesn't use shadows, you could probably just omit it (but that is a matter of personal taste, not really an issue!).\r\n\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI stumbled on something else while testing font sizes: The Search button vanishes when the sidebar is wide.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-24 um 23 34 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6339921/58358450-3d8b5a80-7e7f-11e9-8626-97db8c75c3b1.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-24 um 23 34 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6339921/58358455-411ee180-7e7f-11e9-941d-578a7bf9682a.png)\r\n\r\nIf the button is meant to be on a line with the filter menu (Today, Yesterday,...), then it would be good to  make it narrower (a square with a looking glass or filter icon, maybe? And on the right side of the text field?). This would allow more of the search string to be visible in the search field (or to better read it at a bigger font size). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe menu has no indicator that it is a menu. How about adding a triangle like in the FF dialog in the image above?\r\n\r\n===========\r\nFinally, thanks for making this Add-On. It has already become quite useful for me!",
